# smolKernel
A small kernel I wrote in c over the weekend
## This is now more than a weekend project, it's a project for a school science fair
## How to build
1. Install dependencies: ```qemu-system-i386, gcc, nasm```
2. Run build.sh
## TODO:
 - improve keyboard support
 - add a shell
 - file system?
